CallbackWomen's scope in intentionally limited to:

1. **Conferences**
(Not hackathons, meetups, networking groups, etc.)


2. **Of professional coders speaking to professional coders about topics relevant to professional programming**
(Not academia conferences, founders conferences, conferences for tech executives, etc.
_Yes_ to conferences that meet this criteria yet also cultivate/welcome participation of coders who aren't _yet_ professionals. For example, people who are aspiring, studying, or apprenticing.)

3. **In-person**
(Not an online conference.)

4. **Which fill at least some of the speaking slots via public, open, competitive, CFP process**
(The majority of unconferences don't meet this criteria.)

5. **Of selecting content of substantial length**
(Not when the only competitive slots are for lightning talks, ignite talks, etc.  Whereas giving tutorials/trainings/workshops definitely are content of substantial length.)

6. **And the conference publicly schedules & announces those speakers weeks or months ahead of time.**


NOTE: **The individual _CFP_ must meet these criteria.**
